## About

The [overly-honest methods
section](https://twitter.com/hashtag/overlyhonestmethods) would read
that I thought of this package name before thinking of code to include
in it. Mainly it is a collection of functions intended for
[my](https://sovacool.dev) own use that don’t have an obvious home in
any of the other R packages I maintain. If other people find this
package useful, that’s cool too!
